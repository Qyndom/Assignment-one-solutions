What is Node.js and how does it differ from traditional server-side technologies?
Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment that executes JavaScript outside the browser using the V8 engine. Unlike traditional server-side technologies (e.g., PHP, Java, Ruby), which are often multi-threaded and blocking, Node.js is single-threaded, non-blocking, and event-driven, enabling high concurrency with fewer resources. Traditional technologies typically spawn new threads for each request, which can be resource-intensive, while Node.js handles requests asynchronously, making it lightweight and efficient for I/O-heavy applications.
